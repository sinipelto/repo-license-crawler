pylicense lib does not work
-> calls pypi http -> request limits occur pretty fast (wait 1s, wait 60s ...)

to get importlib.metadata, the package must be installed first through pip

must use pip to install all packages (takes a long time..) -> any other ways? -> not so far

using pip to install -> then parse through req files -> collect packages + license meta -> works OK so far


Nodejs:

npm: packages also need to be installed first

npm cannot install from /path/to/package.json (?) -> somehow collect all packages and install them

We also need to summarize the results for easier reading

The format should be e.g.
{lic1: 2387, lic2: 1237, lic3: 237, ...}
ordered by count, DESC
